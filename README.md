## About
This is a project for **school**. It's meant to be a webapp where users can submit posts containing text and possibly images.

## Tech Stack
**Client:** HTML, CSS

**Server:** Spring Boot Java Framework, PostgreSQL DB

## Yeah..
This is only a school project; yes, the code is horrible and I know that it is indeed vulnerable to XSS and other well known attacks.
